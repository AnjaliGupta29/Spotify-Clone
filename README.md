# Spotify-Clone
If you want to create a Spotify clone with only frontend development, you can focus on building the user interface and user experience without handling server-side logic or database interactions. However, please note that you won't be able to create a fully functional music streaming application without a backend to handle data storage, authentication, and API calls to services like Spotify.
